# ðŸš€ VC_Startups_LinearRegression

This project performs **Multiple Linear Regression** on a dataset of startup investments to predict profit. It's designed to provide insight into how different types of spending (like R&D, Administration, and Marketing) affect a startupâ€™s success.

---

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This machine learning project uses the **VC_Startups dataset**, which includes information about 50 startups and their investment in:
- R&D Spend
- Administration
- Marketing Spend
- Profit (target variable)

We build a **multiple linear regression model** to analyze which features impact profit the most.

## ðŸ§  Skills & Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for model building
- **Statsmodels** for statistical summaries
- **Linear Regression** (Multiple)
